# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
This repository showcases a detailed analysis of global layoff data using MySQL. The project is divided into two main stages: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where the primary goal is to provide valuable insights into company layoffs across various regions, industries, and time periods.

Project Overview:
The dataset consists of key information, including company name, location, total number of layoffs, country, and percentage of laid-off employees. The analysis identifies trends, patterns, and critical insights related to layoffs, enabling organizations to understand and assess global workforce reduction trends.

Stage 1: Data Cleaning

In this stage, the focus was on transforming the raw data into a clean, usable format. Key activities performed include:

1. Data Duplication Removal: Identified and removed any duplicate records to ensure the integrity of the data.
2. Data Standardization: Standardized the dataset by ensuring consistency in naming conventions (e.g., company names, country names).
3. Handling Null and Blank Values: Dealt with missing data through imputation, removal, or other appropriate methods to ensure accuracy.
4. Removing Unnecessary Columns: Removed any irrelevant columns to streamline the dataset and ensure that only relevant data was retained for analysis.
5. Backup Creation: A copy of the original dataset was made before performing any cleaning operations to preserve data integrity.

Stage 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Once the data was cleaned, the next stage involved a detailed analysis to derive actionable insights. Key tasks performed during EDA include:

1. Layoffs by Company & Location: Analyzed the distribution of layoffs by company name and location to identify patterns and trends.
2. Layoffs by Country: Examined the percentage and total layoffs by country, helping to identify regions most impacted by layoffs.
3. Total Number of Layoffs: Calculated the total layoffs across different companies and industries to understand the scale of workforce reductions.
4. Percentage of Layoffs: Investigated the percentage of layoffs relative to the total workforce, providing insights into the severity of workforce cuts by company or region.

Key Insights & Business Impact:

1. Regional Insights: Understanding which countries or regions are seeing higher layoff percentages and understanding the potential economic impact.
2. Company-Level Analysis: Identifying which companies are laying off the largest number of employees and exploring any correlations with company size, industry, or other external factors.
3. Trends in Workforce Reductions: Highlighting potential patterns or cyclical trends in layoffs, aiding businesses and HR departments in preparing for workforce management challenges.

Tools & Technologies:
  1. MySQL: Used for data management, querying, and performing various data cleaning and transformation tasks.
  2. SQL: Applied advanced SQL functions like JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, WHERE, and aggregate functions to analyze and visualize key metrics.

Conclusion:
This project provides a thorough examination of global layoff trends, offering businesses, policymakers, and HR departments critical insights into workforce reductions and their underlying causes. By leveraging MySQL for data cleaning and analysis, this project contributes to the understanding of global economic shifts and helps organizations make informed decisions regarding layoffs, employee retention strategies, and workforce planning.
